See you again

It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way, from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different
See the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
